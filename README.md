# Blooket Hacks (Use for ISU students only)

This repository contains a collection of scripts designed **totally for educational purposes (trust)** related to Blooket. These tools were created by Advik cuz y'all mfs keep begging me for this shit and don't wanna study.

## ⚙️ How to Use

1. Open your browser and navigate to **Inspect → Console**.
2. Copy and paste the contents of `hacks.js` into the console.
3. Press **Enter** to execute the script. (if it doesn't work well then go cry an ocean skid, and fuck u )

> **Note:** These damn scripts violate the fucking Blooket Terms (and I don't give a fuck if you get banned) so use at ur own risk.

## ⭐ Contribute

If you find this useful (ik damn well u will), consider starring the repository.  
Pull requests for improvements or shit like that are NOT welcome and don't beg on my discord if they get outdated!
