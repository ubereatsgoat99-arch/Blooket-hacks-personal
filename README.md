# Blooket Hacks (Personal Use Only)

This repository contains a collection of scripts designed **totally for educational purposes (trust)** related to Blooket. These tools were created by Advik for personal experimentation and learning about how client-side code interacts with web applications.

## ⚙️ How to Use

1. Open your browser and navigate to **Inspect → Console**.
2. Copy and paste the contents of `hacks.js` into the console.
3. Press **Enter** to execute the script. (if it doesn't work well then go cry an ocean skid, and fuck u )

> **Note:** These damn scripts violate the fucking Blooket Terms (and I don't give a fuck if you get banned) so use at ur own risk.
